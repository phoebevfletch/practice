        <h1>The Death of the Biscuit: Why Biscuits don't exist anymore </h1>

        <p>The word "biscuit" has been hijacked, twisted, and turned into a lie.
            The biscuits you see in supermarkets aren't what you think they are.
            They are a government conspiracy. Originally, biscuits
            were a durable, non-perishable food created for soldiers and sailors, derived
            from the Latin <i>bis coctus</i>, meaning "twice cooked." These were the <i>real</i> biscuits,
            designed to last through the harshest conditions. But the biscuits you see today? They're Imposters,
            nothing more than <i>monoscuits</i>.</p>

        <p>The government, in collaboration with big food corporations have brainwashed us into thinking these
            single-baked soggy imposters are the same. Why? Because it's cheaper, easier and faster
            to bake them only once. Efficiency over quality- profit over truth. They have cut the
            second bake and stripped biscuits of their identity, and we have been none the wiser.
        </p>
        <p>But here's the kicker, the modern "biscuit" is designed to go stale faster on purpose. soft,
            perishable and unreliable-this is all part of a larger scheme. By making them degrade quickly,
            you consume them quicker and we always go back for more.
        </p>
        <p>But here is where the conspiracy deepens - Jaffa Cakes. The infamous debate:
            is it a cake or a biscuit? The truth is, Jaffa Cakes are cakes, legally and literally. They
            always were, but that lawsuit was McVitie's greatest marketing ploy. It wasn't about biscuits or
            cakes, it was about generating attention. And it worked - JaffaCakes became their biggest success
        </p>
        <p>While we sit around arguing about cakes and biscuits, the real question—the one they don't want us to ask—is
            far more dangerous: What happend to that second-bake?
        </p>
        <p>It's all part of a carefully orchestrated marketing ploy, a smokescreen designed to hide the fact
            that true biscuits no longer exist. The biscuit has become a victim of modern convenience, stripped of its historical roots and paraded
            under a comforting, but ultimately deceptive, name. Biscuits, as we know them today, are nothing more than
            monoscuits in disguise—just another piece in a grand government-endorsed marketing scheme to keep us compliant,
            distracted, and in the dark.</p>
